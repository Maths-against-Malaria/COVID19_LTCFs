This repository contains the model used for the simulations in the paper ``Preventing COVID-19 spread in closed facilities by regular testing of employees – an efficient intervention in long-term care facilities and prisons?´´. The model allows simulating the dynamic of covid19 in Germany and US long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and incarceration facilities (IFs), respectively.

Files included:

1- Functions.py = script in which all the functions used in the model;

2- Main.py = script from which the simulations are run for the different combinations of model parameters;

3- Model.py = script in which the ordinary differential equations describing the compartments are defined;

4- Constant_IFs_USA = script in which the parameters used for the simulation in the context of US incarceration facilities (IFs) are defined;

5- Constant_LTCFs_Germany = script in which the parameters used for the simulation in the context of German long-term carre facilities (LTCFs) are defined.
